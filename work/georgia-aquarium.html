      <h1 class="heading-7">Introduction</h1>
      <p>The Georgia Aquarium, home to over 100,000 animals, offers engaging and exciting guest experiences that inspire the awareness and preservation of aquatic animals worldwide. In 2018, around 2.5 million guests visited the aquarium, and summer visitor attendance reached record breaking numbers.
        The client has projected that the numbers are going to continue to increase, which will add stress to the exhibit and gallery spaces as well as the dining areas. <br /><br />
        Therefore, the design space of this project is exploring the possible solutions to alleviate overcrowding issues faced in Café Aquaria. This topic space can be broken down to the following central ideas:
        <li>
          The nature of Cafe Aquaria’s ordering and dining experience as it currently exists
        </li>
        <li>
          The needs and pain points of the aquarium visitors
        </li>
        <li>
          The aspects of Cafe Aquaria that are functioning well
        </li>
        Considering these central ideas, we summarized our problem statement as: <br />
        <b>“How might we design a clear, efficient and enjoyable dining experience at Cafe Aquaria?”</b>

      <h1 class="heading-8">Research</h1>
      <p>We conducted the following research to better understand the aquarium&#x27;s current situation and user attributes. </p>
      <h4>About the aquarium</h4>
      <h5>Stakeholder analysis</h5>
      <p>A list of stakeholders involved in the aquarium domain space was organized into categories and can be found in the chart below.
        This chart was built from our stakeholder interviews and observations. </p>
      <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/r-stakeholder.png" width="750" alt="">
      </div>
      <h5>Cafe layout and flow</h5>
      <p>
        When visiting the aquarium, each of us sketched the cafe layout in order to better understand the traffic flow. The digitized layout and flow of traffic can be seen below. By mapping the current spatial organization and the crowd trends we can better understand how the overall customer experience is affected.
      </p>
      <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/cafe-flow.png" width="750" alt="">
      </div>
      <h5>Cafe comment cards</h5>
      <p>
        We were also able to obtain comment cards from the cafe which gave us some additional data from the customer themselves. However, we want to point out that the sample is relatively small (23 respondents), and we do not know the exact dates of when these comment cards were filled out. The comment cards were paper-based
        so we transcribed and analyzed the data ourselves. We can see that customers are unsatisfied with the pricing the most, then the services and information provided by the staff.
      </p>

    </div>

  <div class="section">
      <h4>About our users</h4>
      <h5>Observation</h5>
      <p>
        As we split into groups to observe different areas concerning different dining stages, we could get a comprehensive picture of user journey. An example of our observation table is shown below:
        <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/r-observer.png" width="600" alt="">
              <div class="text-under-image">Observer Notes Table </div>
        </div>

        Afterwards,we made an affinity diagram and found patterns of customer needs and the challenges they faced. <br />
        <br />
        We got five green notes (big categories that can summarize all notes) that are <b>customer motivation, multitasking parents, information needs, flow of traffic, and seating needs.</b>
        Among them, the information needs, traffic flow, and seating needs are the most common customer demands and are pain points caused by the current service design of the cafe.
      </p>

            </div>
      <h5>Staff interviews</h5>
      <p>
        We interviewed 1 manager, 3 cashiers, 1 floor attendent supervisor and 1 floor attendent, and developed better understanding of the schedule, training, team dynamic, current technology, emotions, top concerns of the staff. They also made comments about the top concerns of the customers: first the pricing, second the seating. <br />
        <br />The most noticeable point for our design is the lack of trust: customers don&#x27;t trust the cashier, so they sometimes ask the cashier to reweigh their food to check the price; sometimes they&#x27;ll toss the food or putting it back when finding the price too high, creating more food waste.

      </div>
    </div>


      <h5>Competitor analysis</h5>
      <p>
        We went on the websites of the top 5 aquariums in the world ranked by Trip TripAdvisor to look up the cafes to see their menus, environment, and what they had to offer. Furthermore, we also looked up the TripAdvisor and Google Map photos, ratings, reviews of the cafes within each aquarium.
        <br /><br />For the competitor analysis, we set up a cafe features matrix listing items that we thought were important in having an effect on the cafe experience, as well as features that some cafes had in common and filled in the table accordingly. The table can be found below:

  <div class="section">
    <h4>User Findings</h4>
    <p>
       In order to account for all the customers, we identified the top three most common user profiles from our observations and organized them into personas and empathy maps. We then created user journeys based on those profiles which outlined the touchpoints, emotions and design opportunities for each type of user.<br /><br />
       We decided to use families as the primary user group because they are 70% of the total aquarium visitors.

    <div id="ideate" class="section">
      <h1 class="heading-8">Ideate</h1>
      <p>Up to this point, our team has defined the overall problem space and conducted customer research through various methods to gather insights into the cafe&#x27;s operations as well as understanding the customers at a deeper level. The problems of the cafe can be grouped into five categories:
        <li>
          Customer motivation
        </li>
        <li>
          Multitasking parents
        </li>
        <li>
          Traffic flow
        </li>
        <li>
          Information needs
        </li>
        <li>
          Seating needs
        </li>
        Our ideation process is presented below:
      </p>
            <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/r-ideate.png" alt="">  </div>

      <h4>Sketched concepts</h4>
      <h5>Pre-order kiosk</h5>
      <p>Self-ordering kiosks allow customers to order food themselves, and serve as an additional sales channel to the existing check out system. They can increase customer throughput during peak traffic hours, and increase sales by offering visitors another way to pay for their purchases at the cafe.
        The kiosks give information to customers about what is available without having to enter the cafe, so they can make better informed decisions, faster.
      </p>
      <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/cafe-layout.png" width="650" alt="">
        <div class="text-under-image">Proposed pre-order kiosk layout in the cafe
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/kiosk.png" width="600" alt="">
        <div class="text-under-image">(L to R) Kiosk, Menu Screen, Check-out screen, Payment complete screen
        </div>
      </div>

      <h5>Mobile App</h4>
      <p>
        Our second concept explores the pre-order system in a different format - a pre-order mobile application. As the application will largely be used only once, we are also considering the option of implementing a website that can be accessed by scanning a QR code or going to a link on the internet.
      </p>
      <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/app.png" width="550" alt="">
        <div class="text-under-image">(L to R) Mobile device mockup, Menu Screen, Menu item description screen
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/app2.png" width="550" alt="">
        <div class="text-under-image">(L to R) Check-out screen, Order status screen, Order ready screen
        </div>
      </div>

      <h5>Interactive digital display</h5>
      <p>
        Our third idea is to redesign the current interactive display at the corner of the cafe where people rarely used and its info was outdated. We believe the redesign can tackle the problem of overcrowding by:
        <br />
        1. Making the pricing system more transparent so that customers spend less time at the check-out area <br />
        2. Communicating the food choices to customers before they enter the cafe reducing dwell times at each station<br />
        3. Displaying the location of important places like the condiments and seating areas to give customers a mental model of the cafe layout before they enter the space<br />
        <br />
        The concept sketches below describe the kinds of information and interaction that the digital display can facilitate.
      </p>

      <div class="image-block"><img src="../images/digital-display.png" width="550" alt="">
        <div class="text-under-image">(L to R) map and seating information, Cafe menu information
        </div>
      </div>

      <h5>Feedback on sketched concepts</h5>
      <p>
        Participants were recruited from a pool of Georgia Tech students and interviewed through a semi-structured interview format. A trial interview helped us resequence the feedback session, including the format of the slide deck presented and the question design.<br /><br />
        The sequence of the feedback session was as follows:<br />
          1. Background on project: Outline the current customer experience at the cafe + State the goal of the project <br />
          2. Present all solutions<br />
          3. Conduct feedback session based on questionnaire <br />
          4. Ask follow-up questions for other comments and suggestions
          5. Closing remarks and thanks <br /><br />
        Overall, the ideas are ranked as follows: <b>mobile app > kiosk > interactive digital display.</b> Thus, we decided to focus on the pre-ordering mobile app design.
      </p> <br /><br />

      <h4>Wireframes</h4>
      <p>
        1. Onboarding

    </div>


  <div id="prototype" class="section">
    <h1 class="heading-8">Prototype</h1>
    <p>After we decided on the mobile app idea, we used the wireframes above to create a low fidelity interactive prototype on Sketch to get users' feedback on functions and layout.<br />
      We are currently working on the high-fidelity prototype.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div id="test" class="section">
    <h1 class="heading-8">Testing</h1>
    <p>We plan to have an expert review with the managers at Cafe Aquaria and conduct a usability testing with 5+ users.
